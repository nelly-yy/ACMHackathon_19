Our Hack was to create an app that would help UCSC students and more Freshman recognize the campus better.
Our app was to create a faster way to book a study room in the libraries, as it can be a bit frustrating.
Our app also was to take user inputs and be able to use these user inputs into creating a directory/list of
all the places students can go study at, as it gets a bit crowded during midterms and finals. 
Our app was to also take in user inputs to be able to get fundraising events and club events more aware
and noticed so that students and clubs can benefit when they check the app!
